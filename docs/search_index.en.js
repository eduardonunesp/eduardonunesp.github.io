December 2nd, I attended Blue Hack XP, a data science hackathon that brought together programmers, data scientists, designers, healthcare professionals, and other technology development experts.\n\nChallenges and Ideas\nUpon receiving access to data provided by the Paraná Department of Health and Hospitals, we ensured that no individual was identifiable and strictly adhered to the user agreement, which permitted data use only during the event. We began analyzing the data to extract relevant insights, and one of the key areas we decided to focus on was itinerant care and spending within the public health system. It quickly became apparent that the information across various systems lacked standardization, hindering interoperability.\nFrom the outset of the event, our blockchain development team was exploring how Hyperledger could be integrated into our solution, and this is when we identified the perfect opportunity. Part of our team dedicated time to standardizing the most frequently used fields in the healthcare systems’ tables and creating the initial R scripts. Meanwhile, another segment of the team began setting up an initial and functional environment for the blockchain solution.\nBlockchain + Health Data\nOur healthcare-focused blockchain solution enables organizations such as hospitals, clinics, universities, governmental secretariats, or any other authorized entities to access a super-secure and virtually unbreakable data network that only blockchain technology can provide. In summary:\n\nFully Distributed and Secure Database: An enterprise-grade database that builds trust among involved parties by being fully distributed and secure.\nConsensus Algorithm: Pre-established rules ensure the security and distribution of transactions.\nImmutable Data: All participants within the network hold identical copies of the data, which cannot be altered or centralized.\nComprehensive Ledger: The ledger stores all transactions made by any network member, and only authorized members can access data created in encrypted form.\n\nIntegrations and Legacy Systems\nOne of the most significant challenges any new system faces is integration into environments with existing legacy systems. To address this, we adopted a simple REST API, facilitating the easy addition of new patient entries and care data to the system. This approach allows any legacy system to integrate by simply making HTTP calls. Additionally, to our surprise, Hyperledger Composer provided a complete and well-documented REST API out of the box, significantly simplifying the integration process.\nShared Data Science\nFurthermore, our primary goal of unifying databases and ensuring data distribution led us to emphasize the need for reliable, well-documented, and ready-to-use data from any authorized network member. With the right elements in place, we incorporated the ability to share code developed in R or Python within the blockchain. This innovative feature enables all network participants to utilize and share their insights from data and research effectively.\nWelcome SISSA\nThe health information system utilizing blockchain technology unites, integrates, and securely distributes health data across Brazil, exponentially enhancing data science integration and sharing.\nThe Team\nParticipating in hackathons is always a blend of fun, challenges, and significant learning opportunities.

It was one of the most exceptional experiences I have ever had in my entrepreneurial career, which is still in its early stages.\n\nMy first meeting was on Friday, the 22nd. I knew no one and had no idea what to expect or how the event would unfold. You know that weird feeling of being lost in a crowd? That’s exactly how I felt. By the end of the first day, we had developed a clear idea of what we were going to work on and had formed a dedicated team.\nOn Saturday morning, our newly formed team gathered for a still-quiet breakfast. Then the rush began, an activity the organizers referred to as “From Zero” — continuous brainstorming sessions focused on identifying and solving problems. There were numerous ideas and a fair amount of disagreement until we finally reached a consensus.\nIn the afternoon, it was time to validate our idea. This involved testing and confirming our concept. As an entrepreneur, this is probably the part I’ve always missed: going out into the real world, engaging with potential clients, and asking them if our idea resonated with their needs. It was time to face the facts—were we ready, or were we merely chasing an illusion?\nFaced with uncertainty, we had to decide whether to redo the brainstorming from scratch. The clock was ticking relentlessly at 3:00 pm on Saturday, so we returned to another brainstorming session, though not entirely from scratch. After conducting research on the streets and through social networks, we felt confident that our solution was validated. With that assurance, it was time to dive into coding, working late into the night from home.\nSunday arrived, marking the final day of the event. Interestingly, breakfast was lively and fun, a stark contrast to the quietness of Saturday morning. After breakfast, it was time to reach out to customers and begin selling our product. It may sound crazy, but 48 hours is a short time. While this is obvious, witnessing our product in the hands of the first users—even during the “free” period—was incredibly rewarding.\nOur product started gaining traction; people were actively using it, asking questions, and showing curiosity—all on Sunday. Finally, at 4:00 pm, we finished our 3-minute pitch and presented it at 5:00 pm.\nDid we win? While we didn’t climb the podium, we gained invaluable experience and learning that words can’t fully capture. Our product was moving and garnered some traction. It might not be enough for immediate sales, but it certainly made us proud and motivated us to continue our entrepreneurial journey.\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Adventures/from-zero-to-hero/","title":"From Zero To Hero"},"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/":{"body":"","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/","title":"Golang"},"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/exploring-binary-search-in-go/":{"body":"Binary Search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science, renowned for its efficiency in searching through sorted datasets. In this article, we'll delve into two generic implementations of Binary Search in Go (Golang): an iterative approach and a recursive approach. We'll explore how these implementations work, their time and space complexities, and the benefits of using generics with Go's cmp.Ordered constraint.\nIntroduction to Binary Search\nBinary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half:\n\nStart with an interval covering the whole array.\nCompare the target value to the middle element of the array.\nIf the target value matches the middle element, the position is returned.\nOtherwise, if the target value is less than the middle element, narrow the interval to the lower half.\nElse, narrow it to the upper half.\nRepeat the process until the target value is found or the interval is empty.\n\nBinary Search operates in O(log N) time complexity, making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.\n\nUnderstanding Go Generics and cmp.Ordered\nWith the introduction of generics in Go 1.18, developers can write more flexible and reusable code. In our Binary Search implementations, we utilize generics to allow the search functions to operate on any ordered type.\ncmp.Ordered Constraint\nThe cmp.Ordered constraint is a type constraint that requires the type to support comparison operators (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=). This ensures that the elements in the list can be ordered, which is a prerequisite for Binary Search.\nBy using generics with the cmp.Ordered constraint, our Binary Search functions can work with various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, provided they are ordered.\n\nIterative Binary Search Implementation\nLet's explore the iterative implementation of Binary Search in Go.\nIterative Binary Search Implementation Code Overview\n\nIterative Binary Search Implementation How It Works\n\n\nInitialization:\n\nfirstIdx: The starting index of the search interval (initially 0).\nlastIdx: The ending index of the search interval (initially len(list) - 1).\n\n\n\nLoop Condition:\n\nThe loop continues as long as firstIdx is less than or equal to lastIdx. This ensures that there is still a valid interval to search within.\n\n\n\nCalculating the Middle Index:\n\nmidIdx: The middle index of the current search interval, calculated as (firstIdx + lastIdx) / 2.\nmidValue: The value at midIdx in the list.\n\n\n\nComparison:\n\nIf midValue is greater than the target, the search interval is narrowed to the lower half by setting lastIdx to midIdx - 1.\nIf midValue is less than the target, the search interval is narrowed to the upper half by setting firstIdx to midIdx + 1.\nIf midValue equals the target, the function returns midIdx, indicating the position of the target.\n\n\n\nTermination:\n\nIf the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns -1, indicating that the target is not present in the list.\n\n\n\nIterative Binary Search Implementation Example Walkthrough\nConsider searching for the target value 7 in the sorted list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11].\n\n\nInitial State:\n\nfirstIdx = 0\nlastIdx = 5\n\n\n\nFirst Iteration:\n\nmidIdx = (0 + 5) / 2 = 2\nmidValue = list[2] = 5\nSince 5 &lt; 7, update firstIdx to 3.\n\n\n\nSecond Iteration:\n\nmidIdx = (3 + 5) / 2 = 4\nmidValue = list[4] = 9\nSince 9 &gt; 7, update lastIdx to 3.\n\n\n\nThird Iteration:\n\nmidIdx = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3\nmidValue = list[3] = 7\n7 == 7, target found at index 3.\n\n\n\nIterative Binary Search Implementation Time and Space Complexity\n\n\nTime Complexity: O(log N)\n\nThe search interval is halved with each iteration, leading to logarithmic time complexity.\n\n\n\nSpace Complexity: O(1)\n\nThe iterative approach uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\n\n\n\nRecursive Binary Search Implementation\nNow, let's examine the recursive implementation of Binary Search in Go.\nRecursive Binary Search Implementation Code Overview\n\nRecursive Binary Search Implementation How It Works\n\n\nBase Case:\n\nIf firstIdx exceeds lastIdx, the search interval is invalid, and the function returns -1, indicating that the target is not found.\n\n\n\nCalculating the Middle Index:\n\nmidIdx: The middle index of the current search interval, calculated as (firstIdx + lastIdx) / 2.\nmidValue: The value at midIdx in the list.\n\n\n\nComparison:\n\nIf midValue equals the target, the function returns midIdx, indicating the position of the target.\nIf target is less than midValue, the function recursively searches the lower half by calling itself with updated indices (firstIdx to midIdx - 1).\nIf target is greater than midValue, the function recursively searches the upper half by calling itself with updated indices (midIdx + 1 to lastIdx).\n\n\n\nTermination:\n\nThe recursion continues until the base case is met or the target is found.\n\n\n\nRecursive Binary Search Implementation Example Walkthrough\nConsider searching for the target value 7 in the sorted list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] using RecursiveBinarySearch(list, 7, 0, 5).\n\n\nFirst Call:\n\nfirstIdx = 0, lastIdx = 5\nmidIdx = (0 + 5) / 2 = 2\nmidValue = list[2] = 5\nSince 7 &gt; 5, recurse with firstIdx = 3, lastIdx = 5.\n\n\n\nSecond Call:\n\nfirstIdx = 3, lastIdx = 5\nmidIdx = (3 + 5) / 2 = 4\nmidValue = list[4] = 9\nSince 7 &lt; 9, recurse with firstIdx = 3, lastIdx = 3.\n\n\n\nThird Call:\n\nfirstIdx = 3, lastIdx = 3\nmidIdx = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3\nmidValue = list[3] = 7\n7 == 7, target found at index 3.\n\n\n\nRecursive Binary Search Implementation Time and Space Complexity\n\n\nTime Complexity: O(log N)\n\nSimilar to the iterative approach, the search interval is halved with each recursive call.\n\n\n\nSpace Complexity: O(log N)\n\nDue to recursion, the call stack can grow up to log N levels deep.\n\n\n\n\nComparing Iterative and Recursive Approaches\nAspectIterative Binary SearchRecursive Binary Search\nTime ComplexityO(log N)O(log N)\nSpace ComplexityO(1)O(log N)\nEase of ImplementationSimple and straightforwardSlightly more complex due to recursion\nPerformanceSlightly better due to no recursion overheadPotentially slower due to recursive calls\nReadabilityClear and easy to followElegant but can be harder to trace\nStack Overflow RiskNonePossible with very large datasets\n\nSummary\n\n\nIterative Approach:\n\nPros:\n\nUses constant space.\nGenerally faster due to lack of recursion overhead.\nSimpler stack usage, eliminating the risk of stack overflow.\n\n\nCons:\n\nCan be slightly less elegant compared to the recursive approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecursive Approach:\n\nPros:\n\nMore elegant and closer to the theoretical definition of Binary Search.\nEasier to understand for those familiar with recursion.\n\n\nCons:\n\nUses additional space proportional to the depth of recursion.\nRisk of stack overflow with very large datasets.\nSlightly slower due to the overhead of recursive calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nBinary Search is a powerful algorithm for efficiently searching through sorted datasets.

This article delves into a Go (Golang) implementation of the Top K Frequent Elements problem, exploring both its methodology and underlying complexities. We'll walk through the provided code, understand its logic, and analyze its performance.\nProblem Statement\nGiven:\n\nAn integer array nums.\nAn integer k.\n\nObjective:\nReturn the k most frequent elements in nums. The answer can be returned in any order.\nConstraints:\n\nYou may assume that k is always valid, i.e., 1 ≤ k ≤ the number of unique elements in nums.\nThe algorithm should have a time complexity better than O(n log n) where n is the size of the array.\n\nExamples\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: 1 appears three times and 2 appears twice. They are the two most frequent elements.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1], k = 1\nOutput: [1]\n\n\n\n\nCode Overview\n\n\nHow It Works\nThe provided Go function topKFrequent aims to identify the k most frequent elements in the nums array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:\n\n\nInitialization:\n\nKList: A slice of integers with a length of K is created to store the top k frequent elements.\nfreqMap: A map is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each element in nums. The keys are the elements from nums, and the values are their corresponding counts.\n\n\n\nFrequency Counting:\n\nThe function iterates over each number in nums, incrementing its count in freqMap. After this loop, freqMap contains the frequency of every unique element in nums.\n\n\n\nIdentifying Top K Elements:\n\nThe function enters a loop that runs K times, intending to find the top k frequent elements.\nWithin Each Iteration:\n\nIt initializes two variables: maxFreqFound to keep track of the highest frequency found in the current iteration, and maxCandidateFound to store the element with this highest frequency.\nIt iterates over freqMap, comparing each element's frequency to maxFreqFound. If a higher frequency is found, it updates both maxFreqFound and maxCandidateFound.\nAfter traversing the entire freqMap, maxCandidateFound holds the element with the highest remaining frequency.\nThis element is added to KList, and its entry is removed from freqMap to prevent it from being considered in subsequent iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n\nAfter K iterations, KList contains the top k frequent elements, which the function returns.\n\n\n\n\nExample Walkthrough\nLet's walk through Example 1 to understand how the function operates:\n\n\nInput:\n\nnums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]\nk = 2\n\n\n\nProcess:\n\n\nFrequency Counting:\n\nAfter the first loop, freqMap becomes:\n\n\n\n\nFirst Iteration (i=0):\n\nInitialize maxFreqFound = 0, maxCandidateFound = 0.\nIterate over freqMap:\n\nnum=1, freq=3: Since 3 &gt; 0, update maxFreqFound = 3, maxCandidateFound = 1.\nnum=2, freq=2: 2 &lt; 3, no change.\nnum=3, freq=1: 1 &lt; 3, no change.\n\n\nAdd 1 to KList[0] and remove 1 from freqMap.\nKList now: [1, 0]\nfreqMap now:\n\n\n\n\nSecond Iteration (i=1):\n\nInitialize maxFreqFound = 0, maxCandidateFound = 0.\nIterate over freqMap:\n\nnum=2, freq=2: Since 2 &gt; 0, update maxFreqFound = 2, maxCandidateFound = 2.\nnum=3, freq=1: 1 &lt; 2, no change.\n\n\nAdd 2 to KList[1] and remove 2 from freqMap.\nKList now: [1, 2]\nfreqMap now:\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe function returns [1, 2] as the two most frequent elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime and Space Complexity\nAnalyzing the performance of the topKFrequent function provides insights into its efficiency and scalability.\nTime Complexity\n\n\nFrequency Counting:\n\nIterating over nums to build freqMap takes O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in nums.\n\n\n\nIdentifying Top K Elements:\n\nFor each of the k iterations:\n\nThe inner loop traverses the freqMap, which initially has up to n unique elements but decreases as elements are removed.\nIn the worst case, each inner loop iteration takes O(n) time.\n\n\nThus, the overall time complexity for this part is O(k * n).\n\n\n\nTotal Time Complexity:\n\nCombining both parts, the total time complexity is O(n + k * n).\nIn scenarios where k is small relative to n, this approximates to O(n).\nHowever, in the worst-case scenario where k is proportional to n, the time complexity becomes O(n²).\n\n\n\nSpace Complexity\n\n\nFrequency Map:\n\nThe freqMap stores up to n unique elements, resulting in O(n) space.\n\n\n\nResult List:\n\nKList stores k elements, contributing O(k) space.\n\n\n\nTotal Space Complexity:\n\nThe overall space complexity is O(n + k).\nSince k is typically much smaller than n, this is effectively O(n).\n\n\n\n\nPotential Improvements\nWhile the provided implementation is straightforward, there are more efficient approaches to solving the Top K Frequent Elements problem, especially for large datasets.\n\n\nHeap-Based Approach:\n\nUtilize a min-heap of size k to keep track of the top k elements.\nTime Complexity: O(n log k)\nSpace Complexity: O(n)\n\n\n\nBucket Sort:\n\nCreate buckets where the index represents the frequency, and each bucket contains elements with that frequency.\nIterate through the buckets in reverse order to gather the top k elements.\nTime Complexity: O(n)\nSpace Complexity: O(n)\n\n\n\nOptimizing Current Implementation:\n\nReplace the inner loop that finds the maximum frequency with a more efficient search mechanism.\nAvoid removing elements from freqMap, which can be costly.\n\n\n\nImplementing one of these optimized approaches can significantly reduce the time complexity, especially when dealing with large input sizes and values of k.\n\nConclusion\nThe topKFrequent function offers a clear and intuitive method for identifying the most frequent elements within an integer array using Go's powerful data structures. By leveraging maps to count frequencies and iteratively extracting the top k elements, the function accomplishes its goal effectively for smaller datasets.\nHowever, for scalability and performance optimization, especially with larger datasets, exploring heap-based or bucket sort methodologies is advisable. These alternatives provide enhanced time complexities and can handle more extensive and varied input sizes with greater efficiency.\nUnderstanding both the strengths and limitations of the provided approach equips developers with the knowledge to choose the most appropriate algorithm based on the specific requirements and constraints of their projects.\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/finding-the-top-k-frequent-elements-in-go/","title":"Finding the Top K Frequent Elements in Go: Iterative Approach"},"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/golang-one-month-later-pt1/":{"body":"\n\nMaybe it’s been more than a month that I’m studying Go http://www.golangbr.org/; however this is not the case, the important thing is that I want to share a little of what happened during this period — starting with the fact that I had not been studying a new language for some time (in fact Go is really new, it was released to the public on March 2012, when I was “immersed” in Python and then Node.JS).\nThe Way Go Creates Its Environment\nIn Python, we often use virtualenv to create a package environment that doesn’t mix with the global environment; in Node.JS, NPM makes life even more comfortable to create a dependency environment in the project directory itself. Go has an approach that I found strange at first, but once I got used to making sense.\nThe idea is to create a root directory for the environment, which contains dependencies and sources projects on this path, as well as the compiled binaries in Go.\nIt requires setting two GOPATH environment variables, which is the primary path for Go projects, not just your projects, but in reality, any project you download using the go get command uses this path. The second required path is $ GOPATH / bin, which can be added to your main PATH.\n\nWhere are my sources and binaries in Go?\n\nPackages, repositories, and binaries are all “connected”\nThe next thing I was surprised about was the package system, which concerns how you organize your projects and how you use third party projects and binaries.\nEarlier I said that there is a path to sources? Then I realized that even the path to my Github repository was related to the code path as a local package. Note that the path “src / github.com / eduardonunesp” is the user path in Github and the project for example: “src/github.com/eduardonunesp/sslb” is the path where the project in Go should be used when you download this project using the command “go get github.com/eduardonunesp/sslb”. It will automatically create in GOPATH the src directory and the bin directory, also the code and binary ready to use!\nEven when you are coding in go you will need to refer to third party projects as the full path for example:\n\nIs there an error? No, now there is an error? Now it has? Not? then follow\n\nGo doesn’t want you to miss or forget something; it bugs you with until you learn it.\nExtremely “complain” about this compiler, the metalinter doesn’t even talk about it, Go protect you from yourself all the time. Annoying yes, but it’s your friend and is always warning you that there are unused variables, no return functions, useless imports, and even when deadlocks killed your ordinary program.\nSince Go functions can return more than two variables, it is pretty common to return an error type and a result, so you are continually doing error checks one after the other in heaps. Go even has an exception type called panic, but it’s not recommended overuse it.\nThe code formatting pattern is a rule that you have a program to format your code (it comes bundled and is called go format). To be clear: metalinter is a collection of various static checks. When I pass my code of even sadness, I have to complain that the code is too big, or that my keyboard is dirty, jokes aside, when you follow this linter, the code is standard Go Master.\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/golang-one-month-later-pt1/","title":"Golang One Month Later (Part 1)"},"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/golang-one-month-later-pt2/":{"body":"Editor\n\nThe program that we use to turn coffee into code\nI have been using Sublime Text for some time now, I also like vim (I used it as the primary editor for a long time), I use both, but 90% of the time I am using Sublime.\nThe compiler may even refuse to compile your beloved code because of an unused variable, but it won’t bother you using notepad, you can use any editor at will.\nThe plugin I recommend is GoSublime, highly configurable, and full of sweet combinations; for example, I set it up when saving my code, already formatting, removing unused imports and running linter.

The service I developed is a currency converter that translates USD to BRL (US Dollars to Brazilian Reais).\nWhen a user sends a request to the service, it responds with the current dollar value based on data from the last five minutes. Why the last five minutes? This approach involves a routine that continuously checks the dollar rate via HTTP requests every five minutes concurrently.\nConsequently, when a user request arrives, the service can immediately return the required value without needing to query an external service each time, as it stores the latest value in memory and manages it concurrently.\nDon’t worry if the explanation seems nonlinear; while the process may not follow this exact order, I hope that all the explanations will make sense in the end.\nInitial structure\nTo interpret JSON, we need to associate it with a structure; this is very common in language\nOur data structure, defined using a struct, must accurately represent the response returned by the service when queried. For example, consider a service similar to Yahoo Finance that converts USD to BRL and returns the requested values in JSON format. To handle this response effectively in Go, we need to design a struct that mirrors the JSON structure, ensuring seamless data parsing and manipulation.\nThe initial structure should be:\n\nThe following struct mirrors the JSON format returned by the Yahoo! service.\n\nNext, we will send a request to the service using the following URL and code snippet. I recommend consulting the Yahoo! documentation at https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/ for more detailed information.\n\nThe checker function is designed to return two parameters, aligning with the practice mentioned in the previous article where functions typically return both a result and an error. On line 5, we make an HTTP request using the Get function from the http package, which is part of Go’s standard library.\nWe then check for any errors by evaluating if err != nil. If no error occurs, we proceed to read the response content on line 18 and ultimately return the function’s result on line 24. Regarding the defer statement on line 11, it is a routine intended to execute only when the function terminates.\nBy deferring the closure of the HTTP request, we ensure that it is properly terminated, effectively managing any pending resources. This is an excellent strategy for resource cleanup, preventing potential leaks and ensuring that all resources are released appropriately once the function completes.\nInterpreting JSON\nThe next step is to extract the USD value from the string returned by the checker function. To achieve this, the parseJSON function takes the JSON text result received on line 3 and creates an object based on the requestResult struct. On line 5, the json.Unmarshal function is responsible for parsing the JSON data and mapping it to the requestResult structure. This underscores the importance of designing the struct to accurately reflect the JSON format, ensuring that only the relevant data—the USD value—is extracted and returned. By aligning the struct with the JSON response, we enable efficient and precise data handling, allowing our service to focus solely on the information that matters.\n\nWhen the parseJSON function receives the JSON text result on line 3, it creates an object based on the requestResult struct.

Undoubtedly, one of the most exciting aspects of Go is that concurrency is ingrained in the language’s core. It does not require auxiliary libraries, workarounds, or makeshift solutions.\nThe key components responsible for Go’s concurrency model are the go keyword, channels, and goroutines. The go keyword initiates a function as a goroutine, allowing it to run independently alongside the main thread until it completes. Channels facilitate communication between goroutines by providing a synchronized way to send and receive values. When a value is sent to a channel (similar to a pipe), it is only received if the channel is ready to accept it, ensuring synchronization and preventing race conditions between connected functions.\nAdditionally, Go supports buffered channels, which allow for more flexible communication patterns by enabling channels to hold a specified number of values without immediate receipt. Understanding these concurrency mechanisms is essential for building efficient and scalable applications in Go. For more information, visit the Go Concurrency Tour.\n\nWhen executed, the pool function creates a string channel used for communication with the goroutine initiated on line 3. The presence of the go keyword ensures that the anonymous function runs in the background. On line 5, we define and assign an anonymous function to a variable, which calls the checker and parseJSON functions on line 9 to insert the USD result into the communication channel. The loop on line 14 terminates once a value is received from the channel, addressing scenarios where a request to Yahoo! might not return a USD value by ensuring a value is present from the outset.\nFurthermore, on line 24, an infinite loop is established to execute every five minutes, utilizing the time.Tick function to trigger the loop with the necessary pauses.\nMain function\nLike its C language predecessor, the main function is also called main.\n\nFinally, we reach the concluding steps of our implementation. On line 3, we create a pool using the pool function, which returns a channel. On line 4, the value from this channel is retrieved and stored in the latestResult variable, which, as its name suggests, holds the most recent result. Up to line 19, various initialization routines are performed, including setting variables, checking the environment, and, if necessary, changing the HTTP port (which is essential when deploying to platforms like Heroku). On line 21, a handler is created for the root route “/” and assigned to a function designed to handle HTTP requests.\nAt this point, on line 22, the select statement is used to check if a value was successfully retrieved from the channel.

In the fast-paced world of financial markets, traders are constantly on the lookout for tools and strategies to help them make informed decisions.\nOne such tool that has gained significant popularity over the years is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). VWAP is more than just an indicator; it's a powerful concept that traders use to gain insights into market dynamics, execute orders effectively, and improve their trading strategies. In this blog post, we will delve into what VWAP is, how it works and create our own in Go.\nFirst what is VWAP?\nVolume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a trading indicator that provides a benchmark price for a particular security over a given time period, typically a trading day. Unlike traditional moving averages, VWAP takes into account both the price and the volume of trades. In essence, VWAP calculates the average price at which a security has traded throughout the day, weighted by the volume of those trades. It's calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n\nCreating the trading structures\nSo first lets create the structures that we will use to represent the trades and the VWAP result. We will also create an interface that all trade providers must implement. This will allow us to create a VWAP calculator that can be used with any trade provider.\n\nCreating the VWAP calculator\nNow that we have the structures in place we can create the VWAP calculator. The calculator will take a trade provider and a trade pair and return a channel that will be used to receive the VWAP result.\n\nGetting the trades from the provider\nNow that we have the VWAP calculator we need to get the trades from the provider. For this example we will use the Coinbase Pro Websocket API to get the trades in realtime. We will create a function that will get the trades from the provider and send them to the VWAP calculator.\n\nPutting it all together\nNow that we have the VWAP calculator and the trade provider we can put it all together. We will create a main function that will create the VWAP calculator and the trade provider. Then we will run the VWAP calculator and print the results to the console.\n\nConclusion\nIn this blog post we have created a VWAP calculator that can be used with any trade provider. We have also created a trade provider that uses the Coinbase Pro Websocket API to get the trades in realtime. We have put it all together and printed the results to the console.

This article explores two Go (Golang) implementations of the Two Sum problem: an optimized approach using a hash map and a straightforward brute-force method. We'll delve into the problem statement, dissect both solutions, and analyze their time and space complexities.\nGiven:\n\nAn array of integers nums.\nAn integer target.\n\nObjective:\nReturn the indices of the two numbers in nums such that they add up to target.\nConstraints:\n\nEach input will have exactly one solution.\nYou may not use the same element twice.\nThe answer can be returned in any order.\n\nExamples\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nOutput: [0,1]\nExplanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,3], target = 6\nOutput: [0,2]\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,3], target = 6\nOutput: [0,1]\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1: Optimized Approach Using a Hash Map\nSolution 1 Code Overview\n\nSolution 1 How It Works\n\n\nInitialization:\n\nA hash map resultMap is created to store numbers as keys and their corresponding indices as values.\n\n\n\nIteration:\n\nIterate through each element num in the nums array using its index idx.\n\n\n\nComplement Calculation:\n\nFor each num, compute the desired complement that would add up to the target (desired = target - num).\n\n\n\nHash Map Lookup:\n\nCheck if the desired complement exists in resultMap.\nIf it does, it means we've previously encountered the number that pairs with the current num to reach the target. Return the indices of these two numbers.\n\n\n\nMap Population:\n\nIf the desired complement is not found, store the current num and its index in resultMap for future reference.\n\n\n\nReturn Statement:\n\nIf no solution is found during iteration (which shouldn't happen as per the problem constraints), return an empty slice.\n\n\n\nSolution 1 Example Walkthrough\nLet's consider Example 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nProcess:\n\n\nFirst Iteration (idx=0, num=2):\n\ndesired = 9 - 2 = 7\n7 is not in resultMap.\nStore 2 with index 0 in resultMap: {2: 0}.\n\n\n\nSecond Iteration (idx=1, num=7):\n\ndesired = 9 - 7 = 2\n2 is in resultMap with index 0.\nReturn [0, 1].\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1 Time and Space Complexity\n\n\nTime Complexity: O(N)\n\nThe algorithm traverses the list containing N elements only once. Each look-up in the hash map costs O(1) time on average.\n\n\n\nSpace Complexity: O(N)\n\nIn the worst case, we store all N elements in the hash map.\n\n\n\n\nSolution 2: Brute Force Approach Using Nested Loops\nSolution 2 Code Overview\n\nSolution 2 How It Works\n\n\nOuter Loop:\n\nIterate through each element nums[idx1] in the array.\n\n\n\nInner Loop:\n\nFor each nums[idx1], iterate through the subsequent elements nums[idx2] to find a pair that sums to the target.\n\n\n\nPair Check:\n\nIf a pair nums[idx1] + nums[idx2] equals the target, return their indices [idx1, idx2].\n\n\n\nReturn Statement:\n\nIf no such pair is found after exhausting all possibilities (which, according to the problem constraints, should not occur), return an empty slice.\n\n\n\nSolution 2 Example Walkthrough\nUsing Example 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nProcess:\n\nFirst Iteration (idx1=0, num=2):\n\nCompare with idx2=1 (num=7): 2 + 7 = 9 → Match found.\nReturn [0, 1].\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 2 Time and Space Complexity\n\n\nTime Complexity: O(N²)\n\nTwo nested loops each potentially iterate through all N elements, leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\n\n\nSpace Complexity: O(1)\n\nThe algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\n\n\n\nComparing the Two Approaches\nAspectOptimized (Hash Map)Brute Force (Nested Loops)\nTime ComplexityO(N)O(N²)\nSpace ComplexityO(N)O(1)\nEase of ImplementationModerateSimple\nPerformanceSignificantly faster for large inputsSlower, especially with large datasets\n\nSummary:\n\nThe optimized approach using a hash map offers a linear time solution, making it highly efficient for large datasets. However, it requires additional space proportional to the input size.\nThe brute-force method is straightforward and easy to implement but suffers from poor performance with increasing input sizes due to its quadratic time complexity.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Two Sum problem is an excellent exercise to understand the balance between time and space complexities in algorithm design. By leveraging data structures like hash maps, we can optimize solutions to run efficiently even with large inputs. Conversely, grasping brute-force methods provides foundational knowledge that helps recognize when and how optimizations can be applied.\nIn Go, both methods are elegantly implemented, showcasing the language's strengths in handling maps and control structures. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or enhancing your algorithmic skills, mastering both approaches to the Two Sum problem is invaluable.\n\nHappy Coding!\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/understanding-two-sum-problem-in-go/","title":"Understanding the Two Sum Problem in Go: Optimized and Brute Force Solution"},"https://edoncode.dev/Tech/":{"body":"","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Tech/","title":"Tech"},"https://edoncode.dev/Tech/concurrency-versus-parallelism/":{"body":"\n\n\n\n\nIn a universe where countless events unfold simultaneously and we cannot even begin to comprehend their sheer number, everything is in a state of constant change. This relentless flux often leaves us without a clear direction or the ability to foresee what lies ahead, making it challenging to maintain a steady flow or exercise foresight amidst the chaos.\n\nImagine standing in line to place an order for a meal. As you wait your turn, the cashier takes orders while the person ahead of you steps aside to make a call. Meanwhile, a new order swiftly arrives in the kitchen. Nearby, another attendant is busy serving a previous order, and you find yourself glancing at your powerful four-core smartphone, pondering which movies are playing at the theaters while listening to your favorite band.\n\nThis bustling scene is a condensed illustration of the dynamic environment surrounding us. Over the years, software development has evolved, creating advanced tools, languages, and methodologies to manage our complex “universe” of events.\n\nModern programs are designed to operate asynchronously, handling multiple requests simultaneously by processing previous tasks while calculating outputs for new ones at incredible speeds. This eliminates the need for sequential queues, allowing for intelligently divided tasks and multiple queues that efficiently manage numerous jobs concurrently.\nConcurrency\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who has ever used a computer with only a single processor or core may have experienced the illusion of concurrency without even realizing it. Tasks such as receiving keyboard input, sending video output, playing music (perhaps Pink Floyd), receiving network data, and displaying new emails all seem to happen simultaneously. In reality, a single-core processor handles these operations sequentially, executing small, efficient tasks one at a time, each within microseconds (millionths of a second). This rapid task switching creates the perception of parallelism. However, a program not designed to operate concurrently will never perform satisfactorily on such systems.\nSimilarly, programs that are not built to leverage parallelism cannot effectively utilize multiple processors or cores. Ultimately, hardware alone cannot compensate for software that does not take advantage of concurrency and parallelism.\nParallelism\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous example, when I mentioned “everything happening at the same time,” I clarified that tasks weren’t truly simultaneous but were executed incredibly quickly in succession.\nTo achieve true parallelism, where multiple tasks occur simultaneously, we require more than one processor or a single processor with multiple cores. This hardware allows two or more tasks to run at the same time. However, attaining parallelism also necessitates well-planned concurrency within the software; tasks must be designed to avoid conflicts, locks, or indefinite waits.\nWhen we discuss concurrency, our focus is on the software framework that manages multiple tasks efficiently. In contrast, parallelism emphasizes how these frameworks are executed across multiple processors or cores, leveraging the hardware to perform tasks simultaneously.\nEffective parallelism relies on both robust concurrent design and the appropriate hardware to ensure that multiple processes can run in tandem without interference.\nConcurrency and parallelism together\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have a clear understanding of the necessary concepts, we can proceed to the final component. To effectively integrate concurrency and parallelism, we need to establish a communication structure that is both protected and scalable.\nAchieving concurrency involves utilizing multiple routines within our program, which can be referred to as threads or simply routines. With parallelism, we distribute tasks across multiple processors or cores, but the crucial final element is the communication mechanism—the tunnel or channel that connects these routines. Without effective communication, having multiple routines serves no purpose.\nThis communication must be synchronized to ensure that data does not arrive out of order or cause one task to block another. A synchronized mechanism is essential to allow all jobs to execute smoothly without one operation interfering with another, thereby enabling efficient and harmonious task management.\nFinal considerations\nCertainly, this is a complex subject that encompasses a significant amount of theory, often covered in dedicated courses within Computer Science programs, such as Operating Systems or Multiprocessed Systems.\nI hope this brief article has effectively illustrated and clarified the key concepts. In the next section, I will provide a more practical example, demonstrating how to implement concurrency and parallelism using Go programming.\nSources\n\nRob Pike, one of the creators of Go on his “Concurrency Is Not Parallelism” talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso\nThe paper that influenced a generation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes\nGolang Book https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/10\n\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Tech/concurrency-versus-parallelism/","title":"Concurrency versus Parallelism"},"https://edoncode.dev/Thoughts/":{"body":"","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Thoughts/","title":"Thoughts"},"https://edoncode.dev/Thoughts/from-frustation-to-code/":{"body":"\nIn today’s civilization, technology serves as the driving force behind our daily lives, providing the comforts we rely on until the next global catastrophe.
