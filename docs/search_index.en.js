December 2nd, I attended Blue Hack XP, a data science hackathon that brought together programmers, data scientists, designers, healthcare professionals, and other technology development experts.\n\nChallenges and Ideas\nUpon receiving access to data provided by the Paraná Department of Health and Hospitals, we ensured that no individual was identifiable and strictly adhered to the user agreement, which permitted data use only during the event. We began analyzing the data to extract relevant insights, and one of the key areas we decided to focus on was itinerant care and spending within the public health system. It quickly became apparent that the information across various systems lacked standardization, hindering interoperability.\nFrom the outset of the event, our blockchain development team was exploring how Hyperledger could be integrated into our solution, and this is when we identified the perfect opportunity. Part of our team dedicated time to standardizing the most frequently used fields in the healthcare systems’ tables and creating the initial R scripts. Meanwhile, another segment of the team began setting up an initial and functional environment for the blockchain solution.\nBlockchain + Health Data\nOur healthcare-focused blockchain solution enables organizations such as hospitals, clinics, universities, governmental secretariats, or any other authorized entities to access a super-secure and virtually unbreakable data network that only blockchain technology can provide. In summary:\n\nFully Distributed and Secure Database: An enterprise-grade database that builds trust among involved parties by being fully distributed and secure.\nConsensus Algorithm: Pre-established rules ensure the security and distribution of transactions.\nImmutable Data: All participants within the network hold identical copies of the data, which cannot be altered or centralized.\nComprehensive Ledger: The ledger stores all transactions made by any network member, and only authorized members can access data created in encrypted form.\n\nIntegrations and Legacy Systems\nOne of the most significant challenges any new system faces is integration into environments with existing legacy systems. To address this, we adopted a simple REST API, facilitating the easy addition of new patient entries and care data to the system. This approach allows any legacy system to integrate by simply making HTTP calls. Additionally, to our surprise, Hyperledger Composer provided a complete and well-documented REST API out of the box, significantly simplifying the integration process.\nShared Data Science\nFurthermore, our primary goal of unifying databases and ensuring data distribution led us to emphasize the need for reliable, well-documented, and ready-to-use data from any authorized network member. With the right elements in place, we incorporated the ability to share code developed in R or Python within the blockchain. This innovative feature enables all network participants to utilize and share their insights from data and research effectively.\nWelcome SISSA\nThe health information system utilizing blockchain technology unites, integrates, and securely distributes health data across Brazil, exponentially enhancing data science integration and sharing.\nThe Team\nParticipating in hackathons is always a blend of fun, challenges, and significant learning opportunities. Our team thrived in this dynamic environment, overcoming obstacles and collaborating effectively to develop a robust and impactful solution.\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Adventures/applying-hyperledger-in-healthcare/","title":"Applying Hyperledger in Healthcare"},"https://edoncode.dev/Adventures/from-zero-to-hero/":{"body":"\nLast weekend, from the 22nd to the 24th, I attended Startup Weekend Education in Florianópolis. It was one of the most exceptional experiences I have ever had in my entrepreneurial career, which is still in its early stages.\n\nMy first meeting was on Friday, the 22nd. I knew no one and had no idea what to expect or how the event would unfold. You know that weird feeling of being lost in a crowd? That’s exactly how I felt. By the end of the first day, we had developed a clear idea of what we were going to work on and had formed a dedicated team.\nOn Saturday morning, our newly formed team gathered for a still-quiet breakfast. Then the rush began, an activity the organizers referred to as “From Zero” — continuous brainstorming sessions focused on identifying and solving problems. There were numerous ideas and a fair amount of disagreement until we finally reached a consensus.\nIn the afternoon, it was time to validate our idea. This involved testing and confirming our concept. As an entrepreneur, this is probably the part I’ve always missed: going out into the real world, engaging with potential clients, and asking them if our idea resonated with their needs. It was time to face the facts—were we ready, or were we merely chasing an illusion?\nFaced with uncertainty, we had to decide whether to redo the brainstorming from scratch. The clock was ticking relentlessly at 3:00 pm on Saturday, so we returned to another brainstorming session, though not entirely from scratch. After conducting research on the streets and through social networks, we felt confident that our solution was validated. With that assurance, it was time to dive into coding, working late into the night from home.\nSunday arrived, marking the final day of the event. Interestingly, breakfast was lively and fun, a stark contrast to the quietness of Saturday morning. After breakfast, it was time to reach out to customers and begin selling our product. It may sound crazy, but 48 hours is a short time. While this is obvious, witnessing our product in the hands of the first users—even during the “free” period—was incredibly rewarding.\nOur product started gaining traction; people were actively using it, asking questions, and showing curiosity—all on Sunday. Finally, at 4:00 pm, we finished our 3-minute pitch and presented it at 5:00 pm.\nDid we win? While we didn’t climb the podium, we gained invaluable experience and learning that words can’t fully capture. Our product was moving and garnered some traction. It might not be enough for immediate sales, but it certainly made us proud and motivated us to continue our entrepreneurial journey.\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Adventures/from-zero-to-hero/","title":"From Zero To Hero"},"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/":{"body":"","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/","title":"Golang"},"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/golang-one-month-later-pt1/":{"body":"Maybe it’s been more than a month that I’m studying Go http://www.golangbr.org/; however this is not the case, the important thing is that I want to share a little of what happened during this period — starting with the fact that I had not been studying a new language for some time (in fact Go is really new, it was released to the public on March 2012, when I was “immersed” in Python and then Node.JS).\nThe Way Go Creates Its Environment\nIn Python, we often use virtualenv to create a package environment that doesn’t mix with the global environment; in Node.JS, NPM makes life even more comfortable to create a dependency environment in the project directory itself. Go has an approach that I found strange at first, but once I got used to making sense.\nThe idea is to create a root directory for the environment, which contains dependencies and sources projects on this path, as well as the compiled binaries in Go.\nIt requires setting two GOPATH environment variables, which is the primary path for Go projects, not just your projects, but in reality, any project you download using the go get command uses this path. The second required path is $ GOPATH / bin, which can be added to your main PATH.\n\nWhere are my sources and binaries in Go?\nPackages, repositories, and binaries are all “connected”\nThe next thing I was surprised about was the package system, which concerns how you organize your projects and how you use third party projects and binaries.\nEarlier I said that there is a path to sources? Then I realized that even the path to my Github repository was related to the code path as a local package. Note that the path “src / github.com / eduardonunesp” is the user path in Github and the project for example: “src/github.com/eduardonunesp/sslb” is the path where the project in Go should be used when you download this project using the command “go get github.com/eduardonunesp/sslb”. It will automatically create in GOPATH the src directory and the bin directory, also the code and binary ready to use!\nEven when you are coding in go you will need to refer to third party projects as the full path for example:\n\nIs there an error? No, now there is an error? Now it has? Not? then follow\nGo doesn’t want you to miss or forget something; it bugs you with until you learn it.\nExtremely “complain” about this compiler, the metalinter doesn’t even talk about it, Go protect you from yourself all the time. Annoying yes, but it’s your friend and is always warning you that there are unused variables, no return functions, useless imports, and even when deadlocks killed your ordinary program.\nSince Go functions can return more than two variables, it is pretty common to return an error type and a result, so you are continually doing error checks one after the other in heaps. Go even has an exception type called panic, but it’s not recommended overuse it.\nThe code formatting pattern is a rule that you have a program to format your code (it comes bundled and is called go format).

The service I developed is a currency converter that translates USD to BRL (US Dollars to Brazilian Reais).\nWhen a user sends a request to the service, it responds with the current dollar value based on data from the last five minutes. Why the last five minutes? This approach involves a routine that continuously checks the dollar rate via HTTP requests every five minutes concurrently.\nConsequently, when a user request arrives, the service can immediately return the required value without needing to query an external service each time, as it stores the latest value in memory and manages it concurrently.\nDon’t worry if the explanation seems nonlinear; while the process may not follow this exact order, I hope that all the explanations will make sense in the end.\nInitial structure\nTo interpret JSON, we need to associate it with a structure; this is very common in language\nOur data structure, defined using a struct, must accurately represent the response returned by the service when queried. For example, consider a service similar to Yahoo Finance that converts USD to BRL and returns the requested values in JSON format. To handle this response effectively in Go, we need to design a struct that mirrors the JSON structure, ensuring seamless data parsing and manipulation.\nThe initial structure should be:\n\nThe following struct mirrors the JSON format returned by the Yahoo! service.\n\nNext, we will send a request to the service using the following URL and code snippet. I recommend consulting the Yahoo! documentation at https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/ for more detailed information.\n\nThe checker function is designed to return two parameters, aligning with the practice mentioned in the previous article where functions typically return both a result and an error. On line 5, we make an HTTP request using the Get function from the http package, which is part of Go’s standard library.\nWe then check for any errors by evaluating if err != nil. If no error occurs, we proceed to read the response content on line 18 and ultimately return the function’s result on line 24. Regarding the defer statement on line 11, it is a routine intended to execute only when the function terminates.\nBy deferring the closure of the HTTP request, we ensure that it is properly terminated, effectively managing any pending resources. This is an excellent strategy for resource cleanup, preventing potential leaks and ensuring that all resources are released appropriately once the function completes.\nInterpreting JSON\nThe next step is to extract the USD value from the string returned by the checker function. To achieve this, the parseJSON function takes the JSON text result received on line 3 and creates an object based on the requestResult struct. On line 5, the json.Unmarshal function is responsible for parsing the JSON data and mapping it to the requestResult structure. This underscores the importance of designing the struct to accurately reflect the JSON format, ensuring that only the relevant data—the USD value—is extracted and returned. By aligning the struct with the JSON response, we enable efficient and precise data handling, allowing our service to focus solely on the information that matters.\n\nWhen the parseJSON function receives the JSON text result on line 3, it creates an object based on the requestResult struct.

Undoubtedly, one of the most exciting aspects of Go is that concurrency is ingrained in the language’s core. It does not require auxiliary libraries, workarounds, or makeshift solutions.\nThe key components responsible for Go’s concurrency model are the go keyword, channels, and goroutines. The go keyword initiates a function as a goroutine, allowing it to run independently alongside the main thread until it completes. Channels facilitate communication between goroutines by providing a synchronized way to send and receive values. When a value is sent to a channel (similar to a pipe), it is only received if the channel is ready to accept it, ensuring synchronization and preventing race conditions between connected functions.\nAdditionally, Go supports buffered channels, which allow for more flexible communication patterns by enabling channels to hold a specified number of values without immediate receipt. Understanding these concurrency mechanisms is essential for building efficient and scalable applications in Go. For more information, visit the Go Concurrency Tour.\n\nWhen executed, the pool function creates a string channel used for communication with the goroutine initiated on line 3. The presence of the go keyword ensures that the anonymous function runs in the background. On line 5, we define and assign an anonymous function to a variable, which calls the checker and parseJSON functions on line 9 to insert the USD result into the communication channel. The loop on line 14 terminates once a value is received from the channel, addressing scenarios where a request to Yahoo! might not return a USD value by ensuring a value is present from the outset.\nFurthermore, on line 24, an infinite loop is established to execute every five minutes, utilizing the time.Tick function to trigger the loop with the necessary pauses.\nMain function\nLike its C language predecessor, the main function is also called main.\n\nFinally, we reach the concluding steps of our implementation. On line 3, we create a pool using the pool function, which returns a channel. On line 4, the value from this channel is retrieved and stored in the latestResult variable, which, as its name suggests, holds the most recent result. Up to line 19, various initialization routines are performed, including setting variables, checking the environment, and, if necessary, changing the HTTP port (which is essential when deploying to platforms like Heroku). On line 21, a handler is created for the root route “/” and assigned to a function designed to handle HTTP requests.\nAt this point, on line 22, the select statement is used to check if a value was successfully retrieved from the channel. If a value is present, the corresponding execution path is followed; otherwise, the default case is executed if the channel is empty. Finally, the latestResult value is written to the HTTP response, ensuring that the requesting user receives the most recent USD value.\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/practicing-golang-pt2/","title":"Practicing Golang (Part 2)"},"https://edoncode.dev/Golang/rtvwap/":{"body":"Today I'm going to talk about an analysis indicator know as Volume-Weighted Average Price. In the fast-paced world of financial markets, traders are constantly on the lookout for tools and strategies to help them make informed decisions.\nOne such tool that has gained significant popularity over the years is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). VWAP is more than just an indicator; it's a powerful concept that traders use to gain insights into market dynamics, execute orders effectively, and improve their trading strategies. In this blog post, we will delve into what VWAP is, how it works and create our own in Go.\nFirst what is VWAP?\nVolume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a trading indicator that provides a benchmark price for a particular security over a given time period, typically a trading day. Unlike traditional moving averages, VWAP takes into account both the price and the volume of trades. In essence, VWAP calculates the average price at which a security has traded throughout the day, weighted by the volume of those trades. It's calculated using the following formula:\n\nCreating the trading structures\nSo first lets create the structures that we will use to represent the trades and the VWAP result. We will also create an interface that all trade providers must implement. This will allow us to create a VWAP calculator that can be used with any trade provider.\n\nCreating the VWAP calculator\nNow that we have the structures in place we can create the VWAP calculator. The calculator will take a trade provider and a trade pair and return a channel that will be used to receive the VWAP result.\n\nGetting the trades from the provider\nNow that we have the VWAP calculator we need to get the trades from the provider. For this example we will use the Coinbase Pro Websocket API to get the trades in realtime. We will create a function that will get the trades from the provider and send them to the VWAP calculator.\n\nPutting it all together\nNow that we have the VWAP calculator and the trade provider we can put it all together. We will create a main function that will create the VWAP calculator and the trade provider. Then we will run the VWAP calculator and print the results to the console.\n\nConclusion\nIn this blog post we have created a VWAP calculator that can be used with any trade provider. We have also created a trade provider that uses the Coinbase Pro Websocket API to get the trades in realtime. We have put it all together and printed the results to the console.

By leveraging data structures like hash maps, we can optimize solutions to run efficiently even with large inputs. Conversely, grasping brute-force methods provides foundational knowledge that helps recognize when and how optimizations can be applied.\nIn Go, both methods are elegantly implemented, showcasing the language's strengths in handling maps and control structures.

This relentless flux often leaves us without a clear direction or the ability to foresee what lies ahead, making it challenging to maintain a steady flow or exercise foresight amidst the chaos.\n\nImagine standing in line to place an order for a meal. As you wait your turn, the cashier takes orders while the person ahead of you steps aside to make a call. Meanwhile, a new order swiftly arrives in the kitchen. Nearby, another attendant is busy serving a previous order, and you find yourself glancing at your powerful four-core smartphone, pondering which movies are playing at the theaters while listening to your favorite band.\n\nThis bustling scene is a condensed illustration of the dynamic environment surrounding us. Over the years, software development has evolved, creating advanced tools, languages, and methodologies to manage our complex “universe” of events.\n\nModern programs are designed to operate asynchronously, handling multiple requests simultaneously by processing previous tasks while calculating outputs for new ones at incredible speeds. This eliminates the need for sequential queues, allowing for intelligently divided tasks and multiple queues that efficiently manage numerous jobs concurrently.\nConcurrency\nAnyone who has ever used a computer with only a single processor or core may have experienced the illusion of concurrency without even realizing it. Tasks such as receiving keyboard input, sending video output, playing music (perhaps Pink Floyd), receiving network data, and displaying new emails all seem to happen simultaneously. In reality, a single-core processor handles these operations sequentially, executing small, efficient tasks one at a time, each within microseconds (millionths of a second). This rapid task switching creates the perception of parallelism. However, a program not designed to operate concurrently will never perform satisfactorily on such systems.\nSimilarly, programs that are not built to leverage parallelism cannot effectively utilize multiple processors or cores. Ultimately, hardware alone cannot compensate for software that does not take advantage of concurrency and parallelism.\nParallelism\nIn the previous example, when I mentioned “everything happening at the same time,” I clarified that tasks weren’t truly simultaneous but were executed incredibly quickly in succession.\nTo achieve true parallelism, where multiple tasks occur simultaneously, we require more than one processor or a single processor with multiple cores. This hardware allows two or more tasks to run at the same time. However, attaining parallelism also necessitates well-planned concurrency within the software; tasks must be designed to avoid conflicts, locks, or indefinite waits.\nWhen we discuss concurrency, our focus is on the software framework that manages multiple tasks efficiently. In contrast, parallelism emphasizes how these frameworks are executed across multiple processors or cores, leveraging the hardware to perform tasks simultaneously.\nEffective parallelism relies on both robust concurrent design and the appropriate hardware to ensure that multiple processes can run in tandem without interference.\nConcurrency and parallelism together\nNow that we have a clear understanding of the necessary concepts, we can proceed to the final component. To effectively integrate concurrency and parallelism, we need to establish a communication structure that is both protected and scalable.\nAchieving concurrency involves utilizing multiple routines within our program, which can be referred to as threads or simply routines. With parallelism, we distribute tasks across multiple processors or cores, but the crucial final element is the communication mechanism—the tunnel or channel that connects these routines. Without effective communication, having multiple routines serves no purpose.\nThis communication must be synchronized to ensure that data does not arrive out of order or cause one task to block another. A synchronized mechanism is essential to allow all jobs to execute smoothly without one operation interfering with another, thereby enabling efficient and harmonious task management.\nFinal considerations\nCertainly, this is a complex subject that encompasses a significant amount of theory, often covered in dedicated courses within Computer Science programs, such as Operating Systems or Multiprocessed Systems.\nI hope this brief article has effectively illustrated and clarified the key concepts. In the next section, I will provide a more practical example, demonstrating how to implement concurrency and parallelism using Go programming.\nSources\n\nRob Pike, one of the creators of Go on his “Concurrency Is Not Parallelism” talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso\nThe paper that influenced a generation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes\nGolang Book https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/10\n\n","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Tech/concurrency-versus-parallelism/","title":"Concurrency versus Parallelism"},"https://edoncode.dev/Thoughts/":{"body":"","id":"https://edoncode.dev/Thoughts/","title":"Thoughts"},"https://edoncode.dev/Thoughts/from-frustation-to-code/":{"body":"\nIn today’s civilization, technology serves as the driving force behind our daily lives, providing the comforts we rely on until the next global catastrophe.
