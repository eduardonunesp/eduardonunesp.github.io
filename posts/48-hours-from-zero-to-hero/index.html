<p>Last weekend on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, I attended the Startup Weekend Education; here in Florian√≥polis, it was one of the most exceptional experiences I have ever had in my entrepreneurial career (which also has very new).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our first meeting was on Friday on the 22nd, and I knew no one and nothing of what it would be or how it should proceed, you know that weird feeling of lost in the crowd? That&rsquo;s how I felt. By the end of the first day of the event, we had the idea of what we&rsquo;re going to work on, and we also had a team ready.</p>

<p>Project chosen team formed, Saturday morning a still quiet breakfast. Then the rush began, which the folks at the organization called &ldquo;From Zero&rdquo;, a continuous brainstorming sessions about the problem, many ideas, much disagreement until it came to a consensus.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, it&rsquo;s time to validate the idea, summarizing was like: validates, and confirms. As an entrepreneur, probably that is the part that I&rsquo;ve always missed, I think. It&rsquo;s the part of going out on the street, asking the client or future client, if we&rsquo;re right, or close, or not, it&rsquo;s time to face the facts, are you ready or not, do you have a product or just an illusion?</p>

<p>Should we redo the brainstorm from scratch (and the clock doesn&rsquo;t stop at this time at 3:00 pm on Saturday)? We came back for a brainstorm again, at least it wasn&rsquo;t totally from scratch.</p>

<p>After searching the material on the street and social networks, we considered the solution validated. Then it&rsquo;s time to code until late at home.</p>

<p>Sunday came, the last day, the funny thing was that breakfast was super fun, it wasn&rsquo;t that &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; as the Saturday mood. After breakfast, it&rsquo;s time to run after customers and sell the product.</p>

<p>It may sound crazy, but 48 hours is a short time, it&rsquo;s obvious, but when you see the product walking in and entering the first users, even if the product is in the &ldquo;free&rdquo; period, it&rsquo;s a cool thing.</p>

<p>The product was moving; people already active inside the product asking questions and curious (remembering that it was Sunday). Well, finally, at 16:00 hours, we finished our 3-minute pitch and presented at 17:00 on the clock.</p>

<p>Did we win? Well, we gained a lot of experience and learning that can&rsquo;t be explained. We did not climb the podium, but the product was moving and gained some traction, not enough for selling for sure, but to make us proud, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

<p>TO HERO</p>
