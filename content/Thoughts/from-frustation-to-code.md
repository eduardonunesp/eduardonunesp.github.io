> In today’s civilization, technology serves as the driving force behind our daily lives, providing the comforts we rely on until the next global catastrophe. As we continue to integrate advanced technologies into every aspect of society, the demand for skilled professionals in the tech field grows exponentially. It is essential to address the ongoing need for experts who can develop, manage, and innovate within these technological frameworks to ensure our continued progress and resilience in the years ahead.


However, a situation that has been increasingly concerning is the shortage of developers, scientists, and engineers capable of handling the vast amounts of data we generate. This field presents countless opportunities, yet there are not enough professionals to fill these roles.

I believe there are many talented individuals who are currently unemployed and struggling due to limited opportunities. As technology continues to expand, some businesses are becoming less accessible, while new ones are emerging for the same reasons. 

I’m not suggesting that technology is for everyone—some people may not be interested or may not find IT suitable for them. What I advocate is encouraging curious minds to learn computer science skills, start coding, and rekindle their desire to build and learn. 

The science and technology sector welcomes those eager to grow alongside technological advancements, regardless of age, gender, religion, or skin color. 

The world needs to transform those who feel frustrated and idle into coders, helping us produce more technology and effectively manage the enormous data generated in the coming years. 

Let’s move past the sadness of a concluded career and embark on a new path in computer science. It is never too late to learn.
