## Editor

### The program that we use to turn coffee into code

I have been using Sublime Text for some time now, I also like vim (I used it as the primary editor for a long time), I use both, but 90% of the time I am using Sublime.

The compiler may even refuse to compile your beloved code because of an unused variable, but it wonâ€™t bother you using notepad, you can use any editor at will.

The plugin I recommend is GoSublime, highly configurable, and full of sweet combinations; for example, I set it up when saving my code, already formatting, removing unused imports and running linter. Some people use Atom, which also has excellent support, but I was not used to it.

## Batteries included.

### Much more than batteries say a nuclear power plant.

A joy to see such a rich standard library, has a package for everything, encryption, compression, Encode / Decode, HTML, Hash, TCP, HTTP, RPC, IO, Buffers, and a lot more.

It has so much package ready and quality, which is practically an insult when proposing something that already exists (in innocence, I did it, instead of researching I proposed something that already existed, the people got angry).

## Details
* The compilation is ultra-fast, actually so fast that it seems like the language is interpreted, no kidding.
* Gin is the best web framework so far.
* Already have packages focused on unit testing.
* Learn the concepts of Channel and Routines well, or you will suffer from Deadlocks.
* Be sure to subscribe to Gophers Slack (http://bit.ly/go-slack-signup)
* See also the article Go in practice, where we have a cool project.
